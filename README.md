# Transformer Encoder-Decoder Model Implementation

## Introduction

This repository contains my project on implementing a Transformer Encoder-Decoder model from scratch. The goal of this project is to build and train a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Description

### Transformer Encoder-Decoder Model

The Transformer Encoder-Decoder model is a neural network architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation. It uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences and generate corresponding output sequences.

### Key Components

1. **Attention Mechanism**: Implementing the scaled dot-product attention.
2. **Transformer Encoder Layer**: Building the encoder layer with self-attention and feed-forward networks.
3. **Transformer Decoder Layer**: Building the decoder layer with self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward networks.
4. **Sequence-to-Sequence Model**: Combining the encoder and decoder layers to form the complete Transformer model.
5. **Beam Search**: Implementing beam search for better sequence generation during inference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- TensorFlow or PyTorch

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-encoder-decoder.git
   cd transformer-encoder-decoder

## Usage

1. Running the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
  
2. Open the transformer-encoder-decoder-model-implementation.ipynb file and run all the cells
